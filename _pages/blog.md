This is my blog where I post incremental project updates, smaller one-off projects, random ideas, or just nonsense ramblings.
Most posts will be programming or electronics related - probably stuff that Iâ€™m trying to understand or learn.

Also check out my [Projects](/Projects){: .btn .btn--primary} page for longer-form posts about specific projects I have done.

Below you will see the most recent blog posts sorted by year. If you want a list of posts sort by tag, check out [the tags page](/Blog/Tags/).
